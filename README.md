## Installation

To get started, you need to install the Craftsman CLI. The Craftsman CLI will allow you to create new projects, and also provides a number of helpful commands that can assist you while building your application.

#### Your first Formidable Application

When creating a new application, the Craftsman CLI will clone the formidablejs repository from Github and install all the dependencies for you:

```
npm i -g @formidablejs/craftsman
craftsman new project-name
```

> Note: You only need to install the `@formidablejs/craftsman` package once.

Once done, you can run your application using the following command.

```
cd project-name
npm start
```
